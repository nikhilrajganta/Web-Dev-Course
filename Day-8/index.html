      The Golden Egg. Once upon a time, a farmer had a goose that laid a golden
      egg every day. The farmer used to sell that egg and earn enough money to
      meet their family's day-to-day needs. One day, the farmer thought that if
      he could get more such golden eggs and make a lot of money and become a
      wealthy person.
